# ML-Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-


Machine Learning Project

This project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to develop a robust fraud detection system for credit card transactions. The process begins with data preprocessing to clean and prepare the dataset, followed by exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the underlying patterns and distributions. Feature engineering is conducted to extract meaningful attributes that can enhance the predictive power of the model. Multiple machine learning algorithms are evaluated and compared to select the most effective one for fraud detection. Hyperparameter tuning is performed to optimize the chosen model's performance. Finally, rigorous evaluation metrics are employed to assess the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, ensuring its reliability and effectiveness in identifying fraudulent transactions. The README provides a comprehensive overview of the project, detailing each step taken to build and validate the fraud detection system, highlighting the importance of robust feature engineering, careful model selection, and thorough evaluation for successful implementation.
